/// Authoritative source of the currently active Focus mode on recent macOS.

/// The distributed `_NSDoNotDisturb*` notifications and the `duetexpertd` unified
/// log both became unreliable on macOS 26 — the enable notification may fire
/// without a usable mode identifier, the disable notification often doesn't fire
/// at all, and the log stream can stay silent. As a result the notch couldn't
/// tell *which* mode was on (wrong icon/colour) and missed Focus being turned off.
///
/// `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/Assertions.json` is the file macOS itself writes
/// when a Focus assertion is added or removed. Reading it tells us both whether a
/// Focus is active and its exact mode identifier. The file is protected by Full
/// Disk Access, so this only works once the user grants it — hence `.unreadable`
/// is distinct from `.off`, letting callers leave the legacy behaviour untouched
/// when access isn't available.
